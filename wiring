📟 Control Pins (L298N to Arduino):
L298N Pin	Arduino Pin
IN1	D8
IN2	D9
IN3	D10
IN4	D11
ENA (optional)	Jumper ON or PWM pin (e.g., D5)
ENB (optional)	Jumper ON or PWM pin (e.g., D6)

👁️ IR Sensor Wiring (TCRT5000 or KY-033):
IR Sensor Pin	Connects To
VCC	Arduino 5V
GND	Arduino GND
OUT or A0	Arduino A0

Use analog pin A0 to read sensor values via analogRead() in code.

🧩 Mounting Tips:
IR sensor should be 1–1.5 cm above the ground.

Place it at the front-center of the chassis, facing downward.

Ensure all grounds are common (shared) between Arduino, motor driver, sensor, and battery.
